Hi, I am a PostDoc researcher at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, mentored by Prof. Zhijian Jin. Previously, I obtained my B.E. and Ph.D. from EE, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I was on a research stay at operation research group, Technical University of Denmark, supervised by [Prof. Pierre Pinson](https://pierrepinson.com/) in 2021.

My research interests include predictive and prescriptive analytics especially machine learning applications for power systems, energy forecasting, electricity markets, and decision making under uncertainty. Currently, I am focusing on the interplay between forecasting and decision making.
